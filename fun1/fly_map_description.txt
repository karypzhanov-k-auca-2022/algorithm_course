Bermuda Triangle
A number of ships and airplanes are reported to have mysteriously vanished in the western North Atlantic Ocean
in what is known as the Devil's Triangle, or the Bermuda Triangle. Due to a number of high-profile disappearances,
including the 1945 disappearance of Flight 19, a squadron of five American bombers, the area has become well-known.
The mysteries surrounding the Bermuda Triangle have been exacerbated by the happenings and a variety of theories ranging
from paranormal activity to natural explanations like methane eruptions and magnetic anomalies.
